    title: 'The Heart of 541: Stories from Our Community',
    description: 'This interview-based video captures the heart of 541 Eatery & Exchange, a non-profit café in Hamilton, Ontario, that serves more than just food.\n\nThrough interviews, candid moments, and everyday interactions, this video tells the story of a space built on compassion, dignity, and the power of community. From the volunteers who give their time, to the pay-it-forward button system that helps provide meals to anyone in need, 541 is more than a café — it\'s a place where people belong. \n\nCreated as part of my personal storytelling journey, this piece reflects my passion for using film to spotlight real people and real impact.',
